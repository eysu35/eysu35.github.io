<img src="images/me3.jpeg" width="200" align="right" style="padding: 4px"> I am a first year PhD student at NYU working with <a href="https://todd.gureckislab.org/" target="_blank">Todd Gureckis</a> in the <a href="https://gureckislab.org/" target="_blank">Computation and Cognition Lab</a>. I study language and decision making in humans and machines. Currently, I am working on building a computational model of multi-turn intent detection 

I am interested in intelligence! Of both humans and machines. My research targets machine learning and human cognition, and I hope insights into human communication and decision-making will inform the future development of sustainable AI systems. 

Previously at Princeton, I completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with certificates in Applied Math and Cognitive Science. My senior thesis was advised by <a href="https://cocosci.princeton.edu/tom/index.php" target="_blank">Tom Griffiths</a> and used iterated learning to reveal the inductive biases of CNNs and to probe the effects of sequential training on synthetic data. Following, I continued my research in the <a href="https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/" target="_blank">Carpenter-Singh lab </a> at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, applying graph neural networks to identify drug targets. I have also dabbled in AI security and language model red teaming research.
